# NodeJS Mastery Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **NodeJS Mastery** repository! This project documents my step-by-step journey in mastering Node.js, Express.js, and modern backend development practices using **Bun** as the runtime.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized into modules, each focusing on specific concepts and building upon the previous ones to create a full-fledged e-commerce application.

| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **03-basics** | Core Node.js concepts, server creation, and request/response handling without frameworks. |
| **05-express** | Introduction to **Express.js**, middleware, and routing. |
| **06-templating** | Working with template engines: **Pug** and **EJS** for dynamic content rendering. |
| **07-MVC** | Implementing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for better code organization. |
| **08-Enhancing** | Enhancing the app with better routing, controllers, and data management. |
| **09-Dynamic_Routes** | Implementing dynamic routes, passing parameters, and advanced product details features. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Templating Engines:** EJS, Pug
- **Architecture:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)
